      In C++, an iterator is an object that allows you to iterate over the elements of a container
      (like an array, vector, list, etc.) in a sequential manner. Iterators provide a way to access and manipulate
      the elements of a container without exposing its underlying implementation.

      Iterators in C++ are similar to pointers in that they can be used to access the elements of a container. 
      However, iterators provide a higher level of abstraction and are designed to work with different types of 
      containers.

      There are several types of iterators in C++, including:

      1. Input iterators: These iterators can be used to read values from a container but cannot be used to modify 
        the container.
      2. Output iterators: These iterators can be used to write values to a container but cannot be used to read values 
        from the container.
      3. Forward iterators: These iterators can be used to read and write values to a container in a forward direction.
      4. Bidirectional iterators: These iterators can be used to read and write values to a container in both forward 
        and backward directions.
      5. Random access iterators: These iterators provide random access to the elements of a container, allowing you 
        to jump to any element in constant time.

      Iterators provide a powerful and flexible way to work with containers in C++. They allow you to write generic 
      algorithms that can work with different types of containers without knowing the specific details of each container's 
      implementation.
