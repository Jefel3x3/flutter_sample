      The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) provides a powerful set of algorithms that can be used to perform 
      various operations on containers. These algorithms are implemented as functions that can be applied to different 
      types of containers, such as vectors, lists, and maps.

      The STL algorithms are designed to be highly efficient and can help you write code that is both concise 
      and expressive. They can be used to perform a wide range of operations, including searching, sorting, and 
      modifying elements in a container.

      Some of the most commonly used algorithms in the STL include:

      • std::sort: Sorts the elements of a container in ascending order.
      • std::find: Searches for a value in a container and returns an iterator to the first occurrence of the value.
      • std::transform: Applies a function to each element of a container and stores the result in another container.
      • std::accumulate: Computes the sum of all the elements in a container.
      • std::copy: Copies the elements of one container to another container.
      • std::reverse: Reverses the order of the elements in a container.

      These are just a few examples of the many algorithms available in the STL. By using these algorithms, you 
      can write code that is both efficient and easy to understand, making the STL a valuable tool for C++ programmers.
